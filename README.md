# Google Maps Examples
This repository is a collection of Google Maps examples from articles on my [developer blog](https://nora-soderlund.se/).

All examples are written in JavaScript using the [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview).

## Trying the examples through pages
This repository is hosted through Cloudflare Pages and all examples can be tested directly through the https://google-maps-examples.nora-soderlund.se/ url.

However, as I do not want to be responsible for billing for examples tested through Cloudflare Pages, you must append your own Maps JavaScript API key in the search parameters.

If you do not wish to use your own API key, you can still try all of the examples on its respective article on my blog.
